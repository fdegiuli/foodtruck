== foodtruck

The source to seattle-foodtrucks.com. It is an EmberJS/Rails application, where all of the frontend logic is written in an EmberJS application (including templating and filtering), with the Rails API providing an API to retrieve the  information this, and hopefully most other frontends, would need.

foodtruck is developed under Ruby 2.0, however no 2.0-specific features are used, so 1.9+ should be okay.

Tests can be run with 'rake test', or, if using Zeus, 'zeus test test' (test framework is Test::Unit).
